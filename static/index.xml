      <description>This post is a running list of research papers I&amp;rsquo;m collecting for self-study with the following qualities:
 They include source code [S] or (at minimum) pseudo-code [P] of the core insight of the system / design / algorithm. They do not overwhelm the reader with mathematical notation. The majority are, by my highly subjective account, &amp;ldquo;foundational&amp;rdquo; papers, in that they have had some important influence on their respective subdisciplines. Most are less than 30 pages  Languages &amp;amp; Runtimes The Cuneiform Tablets of 2015, Nguyen &amp;amp; Kay [P] This paper is not really &amp;lsquo;foundational&amp;rsquo;, but it inspired this list.</description>

      <description>At many times in my career, I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled with an overwhelming sense of boredom1 that affects my day-to-day ability to do my job. How can this happen given what an infinitely deep subject computing is? I find it usually derives from the following causes:
Causes of Boredom  The sense the work you&amp;rsquo;re doing isn&amp;rsquo;t societally relevant, that you&amp;rsquo;re merely a cog in a giant military/capitalist water-works The work you&amp;rsquo;re asked to do is tedious and unchallenging, merely a repetition of the same things you&amp;rsquo;ve done many times before The work you&amp;rsquo;re doing is challenging, but the challenge is beyond your skill level and you don&amp;rsquo;t have mentors who can point you in the right direction  Potential solutions Of the above causes, I think the least tractable is the moral/ethical one, and has led me to the greatest dissatisfaction, including at times trying alternate career paths.</description>

      <description>A friend forwarding me this question from a friend working thru a Bootcamp programming. It seemed like a great opportunity to write a post, and I would welcome similar questions:
Question &amp;ldquo;Can you clarify how classes (and really hashes) can more efficiently use keys when the initialization definition is established?&amp;quot;
Response This a great question and a fairly deep topic to be diving into if you&amp;rsquo;re early in your coursework. Which will make it extra fun to try answering!</description>

      <description>The views expressed here are my own and not those of my employer.
This is my professional online presence, so I won&amp;rsquo;t share much outside of my engineering work, but in my free time I like to play my guitar &amp;amp; Octatrack, travel, cook, read, and generally enjoy being an aerobic organism hurtling thru space on this beautiful rock.
My focus  I am forever learning to write elegant &amp;amp; performant systems with a minimum amount of incidental complexity.</description>
